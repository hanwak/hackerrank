## This section explains the problems encountered and the algorithms used to solve those problems

1. Sparse Array
- Implement findme algorithm 
- Problem found in section 2.5.3

2. Extra Long Factorial
- Implement basic multiplication using array
- Problem found in chapter 2 where it mostly discuss about designing an efficient algoithm to compute a complex task
